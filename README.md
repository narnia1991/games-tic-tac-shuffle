# Tic Tac Shuffle

This was one of my job application coding challenge but I made a little twist to the ~boring~ classic game of Tic Tac Toe. You can't rely on your memorized moves anymore.

## Story:

Create a web-based tic-tac-toe game using ReactJS and Typescript. If you do not
know about tic-tac toe, please refer to here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tactoe. Store/Save the matches into a database. Preferably (NO-SQL DB). This is a
two-player game but allow an option to compete with a bot.

### Requirements:

- ReactJS with Typescript
- Store matches with player names, date of match, scores of each player and
  who won.
- Ability to play with Bot
- Impose proper coding styles and component composition
- Having an API to interface with your database is a plus.

### Tech Used
- Typescript
- ReactJS
- Firebase realtime database
- Github Pages
- Styled Components
- React Router v6

## TODO
- Realtime play
  - Save on turn click
  - Disable if not your turn
- Save Shuffle on Firebase
- Current Game History
  - Request Undo
- Timer
- Mobile Responsive
- Overall History
  - Game Replay

## Screens

- - Main Screen

## Notes

- Got the base board design idea from https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/JavaScript-Tic-Tac-Toe/blob/master/script.js
- Got the minimax AI logic from https://github.com/beaucarnes/fcc-project-tutorials/blob/master/tictactoe/7/script.js
